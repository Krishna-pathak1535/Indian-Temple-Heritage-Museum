    "description": "Graptolites were small colonial marine animals that lived in the plankton. Their fossils are commonly found in sedimentary rocks and are excellent for dating rocks from the Ordovician, Silurian, and Devonian periods. The name means 'written in rock' due to their writing-like appearance.",

They have a cup-shaped body with arms used for filter feeding. In the Paleozoic, they formed extensive marine ecosystems and their skeletal remains contribute to limestone formations.",
